# Website Blocker



This projects goal is to blocks websites to remove distractions during a specific period of the day. This would not be possible without TechnoDine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox_fhU7HKl0. The origional application hard coded specific times and websites which blocks users from accessing specified websites. The goal of this project is to add a GUI, make the application dynamic and allow users to set working hours and distracting websites.
