# Website Blocker

The goal of This project is to blocks websites to remove distractions during a specific period of the day. This would not be possible without TechnoDine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox_fhU7HKl0. The original application hard coded specific times and websites which blocks users from accessing specified websites. The goal of this project is to add a GUI, make the application dynamic, and allow users to set working hours to block distracting websites from being accessible from their computers. This was created to address a friends problem of procrasnating using Reddit when studying. 

This project was created on Mac OS and to install this project the user needs to access the host's file in the finder. To start the project run the code in the terminal using sudo to allow for permission. 

This project provides a drop-down menu of certain websites to block during typical working hours of 8 to 4. This can be modified to individual schedules to suit individual needs by a developer. A problem, however, is that websites cannot be removed and I plan to release a new solution soon.
